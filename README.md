### Project Overview
---
This project is to explain my Data Analysis journey with LITA, starting from EXCEL Class with Mushin Hammed to SQL Class with Femi Adebayo and to POWERBI Class with Temidayo Teedee. 

### Data Analysis Process
---
This process involves the following:

- Identifying and Questioning
- Data Gathering
- Data Cleaning
- Data Visualization

  ### Data Analysis Tools
  ---
  - Microsoft Excel [ Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
    1. For Data cleaning
    2. For Data Analysis
    3.  For Data Visualization
  - SQL - Structured Query Language for Quering of Data
  - Github for Portfolio Building
  - POWERBI for Data Visualization [ Download Here](https://www.miccrosoft.com)

    ### Data Cleaning and Preparations
    ---
    The process of cleaning and preparing data involves different steps which includes:

     a.  Data loading and inspection

     b.  Handling missing variables

    c.  Data Cleaning and formatting

    ### Exploratory Data Analysis
    ---
    This involves the exploration of the Data to answer some questions about the Data such as :

   -  Which Branch of the company is selling the most product
   -  Which product are top sellers
   -  Which Year has the most sales?

### Data Visualization

 #### DAta Analysis
  ---
  This is where I learnt how to write and run basic lines of code or queries and some Data Analysis Expression;

```SQL
select * from Customers
where customername = Olasunbo
